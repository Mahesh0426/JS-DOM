### Explain DOM to 7 years old kid?

Ans: The DOM is like a map of a playground park (website) showing where all the slides, swings, and gyms equipment(buttons, text, and pictures) . With JavaScript, you can use this map to move things around or make them change color, just like playing with toys on a playground.

### what is variable?

Ans: Variables is a container for storing data values which can hold different typesnof data such as string, numbers,boolean, arrays, objects ,functions etc. Variable are decleared using var,let,const and automatically.

### what are the different ways of declearing variables in JS?

ans: There are 3 ways to declare variable in JS. They are var , let, constant . Syntax for declaring variable is keywords nameOfVariable = value;
for eg :

```

### when to use var,let or const?

Ans: i.Use const by Default: If the value of the variable will not change after initialization, use const.
for eg

```javascript
const PI = 3.14;
```

ii. Use let when Variables need to Change: If the value of the variable will change during the execution of your program. for eg :

```javascript
let num1 = 4;
```

iii.Use var Only When Necessary: In modern JavaScript, var is generally avoided due to function scoping behaviour.

### how to tell name a to variable?

Ans: If you want to name a variable "a" in JS, you simply use the var, let, or const keyword followed by the variable name "a", an equal sign (=), and then assign a value to it.

### what is syntax in programming language?

```

### what is garbage collection?

Ans : Garbage collection in programming is the process of cleaning up memory by getting rid of things that are no longer useful. It helps keep your program running smoothly and prevents it from using more memory than it needs

### What are data types?

ans: Data types are the kind of values which can be hold by variables. There are two type sof data types in Js.

###### Primitive Data Types:

(i). Number: Represents numeric values. It includes integers and floating-point numbers.
(ii). String: Represents textual data enclosed within single or double quotes.
(iii). Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
(iv). Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, or a function that does not return a value.
(v). Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
(vi). Symbol: Represents a unique identifier introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Symbols are often used as property keys in objects to avoid naming conflicts.

###### Non-Primitive Data Types (also known as reference types):

(i). Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be of any data type, including other objects.
(ii). Array: Represents a collection of elements, which can be of any data type, accessed by their index.
(iii). Function: Represents a block of reusable code that performs a specific task when called or invoked.

(iv). Date: Represents a specific moment in time, typically used for date and time-related operations.

#### what is an array?

ans: Array is a special types of variables which can store multiple values. Values can be any data type such numbers, string, boolean etc. for eg : TO CERATE AN ARRAY we write values inside big bracket[].

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

#### what is an object?

Ans: Objects is a reference data type that allow to store collections of key-value pairs, where each key has a unique property. TO CREATE AN ONJECT use curly braces {}.
for eg :

```javascript
let Person = { name:"Ramesh, age:22, address:"sydney"};
```
